The ship can stock raw materials and parts at 5,000 credits per ton; these parts can then be used to “pay” ship repair or maintenance costs when conventional shipyards are unavailable. The factory can also create and repair vehicles, TL4 equipment, space habs, and planetary structures with these parts at a rate of 10,000 credits worth of construction a day. If a mobile extractor is available, the raw materials processed by the latter unit can be used to feed the factory. Operating a mobile factory requires at least 100 well-trained personnel. Each 10 fewer available doubles repair or maintenance times."
